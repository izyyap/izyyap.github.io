      <h3>About</h3>
      <p> Izy Yap currently works and lives in London. She studied at Wycombe Abbey School and graduated from the University of Bristol with a BA in History of Art with her dissertation exploring the masculine identity crisis in fin-de-si√®cle Vienna. She was also accepted for undergraduate study at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). She has worked consistently as an editorial assistant at Wallpaper* Magazine and is being mentored by the then editor-in-chief Tony Chambers.
      <br>Izy is a self-taught artist, greatly inspired by the works of Lucien Freud, Francis Bacon, Henry Moore and Egon Schiele, to name a few. Having very fond memories of trips to the comicbook store with her father she is also an avid Spiderman fan and was very sad when Stan Lee and Steve Ditko died; however, a cheese platter has never failed to cheer her up.
